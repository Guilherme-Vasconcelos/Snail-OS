# Libraries
In this directory you will find my implementation of C standard library,
which will be used by the kernel. The respective headers are located
at `include/`.

Since most C headers are provided by the standard library, initially
there are only a few headers to be used (those which come with the
cross-compiler).

A list of available headers (besides the ones I have created) can be found at
[OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones#Freestanding_and_Hosted_Environments).
